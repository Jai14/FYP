# Detecting Distracted Driving Using PyTorch

This project aims to detect distracted driving using PyTorch, serving as a final year project.

## Overview

The project utilizes deep learning techniques implemented in PyTorch to detect instances of distracted driving in images. It can be used for research purposes, as well as for developing real-world applications such as driver monitoring systems.

## Dataset

The training dataset used in this project can be obtained from [Kaggle - State Farm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection).

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all dependencies installed (details in `requirements.txt`).
3. Train/Test the model using the provided training set.
4. Test the model with new data or real-world images.

## Training Set Details

Details of the training images can be found in the `training_set.txt` file. This file contains a list of image filenames along with their labels (e.g., "yes" for distracted driving and "no" for non-distracted driving).

## Known Issues

If the Jupyter Notebook `FYP_test.ipynb` does not load properly, please try reloading it a few times. Alternatively, you can download the file for better readability.
